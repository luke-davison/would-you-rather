# Would You Rather...?

In the second week of the EDA bootcamp we started spending one day each week working on a project in a group.  This is our first project that we created.

At this stage we hadn't done much more than establishing basic javascript and learning how to use Express with Handlebars - so that is all we used.

It is a simple app that poses you a question.  Would you rather [option1] or [option2]?  Each option is randomly picked from an array (because we hadn't covered databases yet).  Your response is then sent back to the server and is stored in an array (again, no databases yet) so that it can display what everyone's most preferred options were.

If I ever have time I intend to change the backend so that it saves the information into a database so that this can be displayed online and it won't forget the existing table of answers when the server is reset.
